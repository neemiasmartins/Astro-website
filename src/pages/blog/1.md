Last Friday, I began a new chapter in my academic journey: I officially assumed a position as a tenured faculty member at the Federal University of Vi√ßosa (UFV).

I now say goodbye to  UNICAMP, where I recently completed my Ph.D., and to PUC-Campinas, where I had the opportunity to teach during a semester marked by hard work, dedication, and meaningful recognition. 

It is with great joy and hope that I return to the university where I completed both my undergraduate and master's studies, now as a professor.

Throughout this journey, I have counted on the unconditional support of my beloved Sarah and my family. I am also grateful to the friends, colleagues, professors, and students who, at different moments, blessed me with their company, help, and encouragement. _"Thus far the Lord has helped us."_
